description: Phase skill for super-ultra-code-plan, unattended mode. Takes an already approved plan to a verified, registered pull request while the user is away, with an entry gate, hard stops, a retry budget, and a morning handoff file. Load only from super-ultra-code-plan, after the plan is Approved, when the user says they are leaving ("overnight", "check back later", "tinggal tidur").

# Overnight Run

> Part of `super-ultra-code-plan`. Read `sucp-rules` too. This skill adds no new gate to the normal path. It only fixes what "unattended" means, so the rules already in `sucp-rules` (Unattended Continuation, Autonomous Completion Bias, Isolated Worktree, Draft PR) and `sucp-verify-deliver` (5.1 to 5.3) apply with nobody watching. The HARD GATE and every approval gate stay in the orchestrator.

The deliverable is a verified pull request that is waiting for a human. It is never a merge.

## 1. Entry gate (a human, before leaving)

Every line must hold. If one does not, STOP, name the line, and write nothing. Approval cannot be collected at 3 a.m., so a missing approval is a stop, not a guess.

| # | Check | How |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The plan exists and says `status: Approved` | Read the plan file. `Draft` is a stop: run brainstorm and plan first. |
| 2 | The approved scope names the pull request as its deliverable | This is the standing inclusion that `sucp-rules` (Draft PR as Externally Visible Publication) requires. Unnamed means ask now, while awake. |
| 3 | `gh auth status` succeeds and `git fetch origin main` succeeds | 5.3: a token problem found after twenty commits is the worst place to find it. |
| 4 | The user's limits are recorded in the plan | Optional deadline ("no new chunk after 06:00"), paid services allowed, paths that are off limits. Absent means none. |

Collect this gate while the user is present, as one question-tool call through the Confirmation Protocol (header `Overnight`, options `Start the overnight run (Recommended)` and `Not yet`) once the four checks hold. After the user leaves, nothing is asked: a mid-run decision follows the Unattended Continuation Rule (section 3), and the debt-sweep question stays the last act (section 5), asked only when the harness has an interactive client.

When every line holds, the first file the run writes is the handoff (path in section 5) with `Result: running`, the start time as ISO 8601 with its UTC offset, and `Last update: <time> <checklist item>`. A run that dies (usage limit, sleep, crash) then leaves a record on disk instead of nothing. A failed check still writes nothing.

## 2. What the run may and may not do

| Runs without a human | Always waits for a human |
|---|---|
| Claim the slot (`pr-registry claim`), create the worktree, fan out subagents inside it | Merging into the base branch, including auto-merge |
| TDD, local verification, parent diff audit | Force push or force-with-lease, on any branch |
| Parent-only commits on the session branch, push of that branch (rebase-and-push only) | Deploy, publish, release, or any change to a live system |
| `gh pr create --body-file`, then `pr-registry pr` | Anything outside the repo and its session worktree, including promoting a rule to a global file |
| Plan checklist, debt sweep, learning harvest, graph sync | Widening scope, or deleting state the session did not create |
| | Paid or metered services the plan does not name |

## 3. Decisions with nobody to ask

- The Unattended Continuation Rule applies word for word: take the most reasonable reading, state it in one line, continue.
- Every such decision is one line in the handoff under `Decisions`: the reading taken and the alternative rejected, so the morning review can overturn it cheaply.
- A decision that is irreversible and could go either way is not made. Do all the preparation, write the question and the recommended answer under `Waiting on a human`, park that chunk, and keep working on the independent ones.
- No blocking question mid-run. The only question this run asks is the debt sweep's, and it is the last act (section 5).

## 4. Retry budget and stops

- A red chunk is re-chunked and re-dispatched alone, at most **2 attempts**, and the second must differ from the first. A third failure marks the chunk `blocked` in the handoff with the failing command and its exit code. The other chunks continue.
- The same failure signature in two different chunks means a shared cause. Stop dispatching new chunks and investigate the contract and the shared input before touching more code.
- Never turn a red result green by weakening the check: no skipped or deleted test, no loosened assertion, no `--no-verify`, no gate edited to pass. Unattended runs make this the most tempting shortcut, so it is stated here.
- A deadline recorded at the entry gate stops new dispatch. Chunks already in flight finish.
- **A text-only end of turn with open checklist items is a report.** Before ending a turn with no tool call, read the plan checklist. If an item is still `[ ]` and no blocker is written for it, the turn does not end: take the next item in the same message. Four endings are refused while work is owed: (1) a long summary that closes by announcing the next step, with no tool call, so the step never starts; (2) an offer to carry on unless the user would prefer otherwise, which waits for an answer nobody will give; (3) a list of decisions for the user when, by the run's own account, none of them blocks the remaining work (those go under `Waiting on a human`, section 3); (4) deciding this is a good place to report because the turn is long or a milestone is done. A status note goes in the same message as the next tool call. The stops that are valid are the ones where nothing can move without a human, a deadline recorded at the entry gate (above), a `budget_limited` wrap-up (`sucp-rules`, Goal Continuation), or a blocker deliberately protected from the run. This does not relax the table in section 2.
- **Anything still running is not done.** A background command, a pending subagent, or a local job started in this run keeps its checklist item open. Wait for it and read its output before the item counts.
- **The handoff is the run record.** After each checklist item turns `[x]` or a chunk is marked `blocked`, rewrite the handoff's `Last update` line and add the matching Evidence or Blocked row. Provenance: this follows the run record in "Building effective agent automations" (claude.dev, published 2026-10-08, read 2026-10-10). No overnight run here has died mid-run on record yet; tighten or delete this after the first handoff that shows one.
- **Automatic continuations are capped.** When a harness or hook re-prompts the run on the same task with items still open, stop after the third re-prompt that adds no new evidence. Mark the task `blocked` in the handoff with what each attempt changed, so a run that is genuinely stuck ends where a human can review it.
- Provenance: this rule comes from published prompting guidance for one model family (Opus 5.5, read 2026-10-10), reworded to hold for any model. No incident in this repository has measured it. Keep it, tighten it, or delete it after the first overnight handoff that shows an early stop or a clean run without one.
- Work that never reaches `verified` gets **no pull request**. The registry refuses to record a PR before `verified`, and an unregistered PR is invisible to the merge order. Leave the committed branch and worktree intact and say so in the handoff.

## 5. Close

1. `verified`, then the PR from `templates/pull-request-template.md`, then `pr-registry pr <session> --number <N>`.
2. Finish the handoff started at the entry gate, as a sibling of the plan (never inside it, plans stay small): `<plan-dir>/<plan-id>-overnight-handoff.md`. Replace `Result: running` with the final result and list the sweep question under `Waiting on a human`, so the record is complete before anything that can block is called.
3. Run the debt sweep (`sucp-debt-sweep`) as usual, with one change: **no follow-up executes unselected**. The multi-select question is the last act of the run, asked only when the harness has an interactive client. If no structured question tool exists, no client is attached, or no answer arrives, every follow-up goes to the plan backlog with its `defer: <ceiling>, <upgrade-trigger>` marker. That is the sweep's own degrade path, so the session is complete either way.

| Handoff section | Content |
|---|---|
| Result | PR URL and number, session state, branch, worktree path. Or "no PR" with the reason. A handoff that still says `running` with no live process means the run died; its `Last update` names the last finished item |
| Evidence | Each verification command and its exit code |
| Decisions | One line each, from section 3 |
| Blocked | Chunk, failing command, exit code, attempts used |
| Waiting on a human | The merge, the sweep question, any parked decision with a recommended answer |
| Undo | Close the PR, `pr-registry state <session> closed`, remove the worktree, delete the session branch |

The first line of the final message is the PR URL, or the word `none` and why.
