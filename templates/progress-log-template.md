# Progress Log: [Task Name]

> The checklist in this file is the only to-do list for a task. Do not use the
> harness's own todo tool (`todowrite`, `TodoWrite`, `update_plan`): it duplicates
> this list and is lost on compaction or a harness switch.
>
> The parent owns the checklist. Subagents return reports and never maintain one.

> Persistent task state. Update this file after EVERY meaningful checkpoint.
> This is the single source of truth for task progress across all sessions.

## Error Ledger

> Centralized failure aggregation. Independent tasks are NOT halted by a sibling's failure.
> Dependent chains halt at the failed node (`FAILED-BLOCKING`); independent-task failures are isolated (`FAILED-ISOLATED`). Report as one batch at end of turn.

| Task | Step | Classification | Exit | Expected | Transient | Root cause | Evidence (log tail) | Retry used | Fallback used | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [T3] | [2] | [environment] | [127] | [0] | [false] | [dep X absent] | [tail of stderr] | [0/1] | [none] | `FAILED-ISOLATED` |
| [T5] | [4] | [code] | [1] | [0] | [unknown] | [null deref] | [tail of stderr] | [0/1] | [none] | `FAILED-BLOCKING` |

---

## Evidence Trail

| Checkpoint | Command | Exit | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| [e.g. Repro test GREEN] | `bun test repro.test.ts` | 0 | 1 passed |
| [e.g. Full suite] | `bun test` | 0 | 42 passed, 0 failed |

## Follow-Up Backlog (Session-Close Debt Sweep)

> Every noticed-but-unclosed item lands here so no debt leaves the session unrecorded.
> `NOW` = closable in this session. `LATER` = needs a new plan, an external dependency, or a real scope decision.

| # | Follow-up (outcome + path + finish line) | Class | `defer: <ceiling>, <upgrade-trigger>` | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | | `NOW` / `LATER` | | `OPEN` / `DONE` / `DECLINED` / `DEFERRED` |

- [ ] 3-5 ranked follow-ups injected as one question-tool call of multi-select checkboxes, not as a prose report.
- [ ] Every selected follow-up executed through the full pipeline with fresh evidence.
- [ ] Declined and out-of-cap items written above, never dropped.
