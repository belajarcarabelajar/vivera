### Verification matrix

| Change surface | Minimum evidence |
|---|---|
| Behavior | Focused test or reproducible check for each acceptance criterion |
| Regression | Relevant neighboring tests and unchanged contracts, plus every surface the tasks' `impacts` declared, each one either re-verified or recorded as a follow-up |
| UI/accessibility | Rendered behavior, interaction states, keyboard/accessibility checks where applicable |
| API/data/migration | Contract/schema validation, migration or rollback check, affected consumer check |
| Security/permissions | Allowed and denied paths, boundary validation, secret-handling review |
| Code review/diff | Intended-file review, no accidental changes, no secrets, reviewer or documented self-review |
| CI/repository gates | Required checks for the affected surface, including integration/contract checks when applicable (browser e2e only on explicit user request) |
| Compatibility | Consumer impact, versioning or migration decision, rollback and data-preservation check |
| Reproducibility | Documented environment, versions, setup, fixtures, commands, and expected outputs reproduce the result |
| Test reliability | Deterministic/isolation check, flaky-test classification, cleanup, and bounded retry evidence |
| Performance | Targeted measurement when performance is part of the request or risk |
| Operations/rollout | Observability signal, rollout/rollback check, and post-deployment verification when applicable |
| Privacy/data governance | Classification, minimization, access, redaction, retention, deletion, and audit behavior when applicable |
| Supply chain | Lockfile, license, vulnerability, integrity, provenance, and generated-artifact review when applicable |
| UX completeness | Applicable loading, empty, error, recovery, keyboard, accessibility, responsive, and localization states |
| Definition of Done | Every applicable gate and acceptance criterion is complete, evidenced, and traceable |
| Build/deployment | Relevant build/package/deploy check when the deliverable includes it |
| Documentation/configuration | References, examples, and configuration behavior match the implementation |
| Session close / debt sweep | Every noticed-but-unclosed item classified `NOW`/`LATER`, 3-5 ranked follow-ups injected as one question-tool call of multi-select groups, each selection executed with fresh evidence or explicitly deferred with a `defer:` marker |
