Note: the graphify rules below apply when the `graphify` CLI and `graphify-out/graph.json` exist (run `graphify update .` to build the graph; see install.sh to install the CLI). If they are absent, skip the graphify steps and use normal file reading.

Vivera is a fictional name inspired by Elli, a character in Harvest Moon: Back to Nature. It names this repository, which the flavor vocabulary calls the farm. Documents and tool output may use Harvest Moon: Back to Nature flavored terms: the shipping bin (PR registry), Harvest Sprites (subagents: watering is keep-alive, animal care is long-lived assets, harvesting is shipping), the Blue Feather (a pull request), and Power Berries (permanent capability upgrades). The mapping lives in docs/vivera-glossary.md; commands and paths keep their literal meaning.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

When the user types `/graphify`, use the installed graphify skill or instructions before doing anything else.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- Dirty graphify-out/ files are expected after hooks or incremental updates; dirty graph files are not a reason to skip graphify. Only skip graphify if the task is about stale or incorrect graph output, or the user explicitly says not to use it.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).

## upgrade-hygiene

Set by user 2026-10-06: every successful upgrade ends with the old version removed, so nothing exists twice. Delete session backup copies, auto-created `*.bak` files, and uninstalled packages once the new version is verified. Revert paths must not depend on the deleted copies — re-download the old release, reinstall via the package manager, or `git checkout` the repo file instead.
